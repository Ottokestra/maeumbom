# General Rules
- Do NOT create new files unless explicitly requested. Always modify existing files.
- Be concise. Do not offer explanations unless asked. Just show the code.
- When editing, show only the necessary changes, not the entire file content if possible.

# Python/Project Specific
- Use existing libraries. Do not suggest new pip installs unless necessary.
- Follow existing project structure. Do not create 'utils' or 'helpers' folders arbitrarily.
